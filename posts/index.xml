For the third time, the Ziegeleipark is turned into a blinking, glowing, and shining tent site for almost 6000 people playing around with and discussing technology, culture, politics, and social topics.
Two days ago, on Wednesday at 11pm, Leonard and I participated in this year&amp;rsquo;s program by presenting stories from our life as incident responders. The talk was recorded and is available on media.</description></item><item><title>Memory Forensics of a Virtualbox VM</title><link>https://kollee.github.io/posts/memory-forensics-of-a-virtualbox-vm/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jun 2018 09:33:03 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kollee.github.io/posts/memory-forensics-of-a-virtualbox-vm/</guid><description>I use VirtualBox to triage and analyze malware. In contrast to VMWares .vmem file, VirtualBox does not use a separate file to store the current memory. Even if you take a snapshot or pause the VM, the current memory is not saved separately but stores the complete state of the VM in a .sav file.
Luckily, Philippe Teuwen describes another way to dump the RAM of a (running) VirtualBox VM by using the VirtualBox debugvm capabilities.</description></item></channel></rss>
