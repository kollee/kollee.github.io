Today is day 4 of the 2023 Chaos Communication Camp in Mildenberg. For the third time, the Ziegeleipark is turned into a blinking, glowing, and shining tent site for almost 6000 people playing around with and discussing technology, culture, politics, and social topics.

Two days ago, on Wednesday at 11pm, Leonard and I participated in this year's program by presenting stories from our life as incident responders. The talk was recorded and is available on [media.ccc.de](https://media.ccc.de/v/camp2023-57062-stories_from_the_life_of_an_incident_responder).

Overall the camp was great. The organization was great for a simple participant. I just had one minor issue - no available power connections because they were already occupied. However, this was my own fault. When I arrived at the campsite, the nearest power distributor still had some available connections. Unfortunately, I waited too long to get my cable drum out of my car. When I finally managed to do so, the power distributor had no available connections any more.

I'll drive home tomorrow and look forward to the next CCC event. After four years, we are all waiting for the 37th iteration of the Chaos Communication Congress, probably in Hamburg again. However, I'll see the discussions popping up if you do a congress with 15000 people and not turn it into a SARS-CoV-2 super-spreading event. Even an outdoor event like the camp had several infections until now, and we will see how the situation will look in the coming week.
